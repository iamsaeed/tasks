## Approach 
The project was pretty simple to design and develop. I started with setting up the database and eloquent relations first (this is my standard approach for most new projects).

I used the pre-existing Laravel UI package which is generally available in Laravel 7, but I changed the FrontEnd framework from Bootstrap 5 to Tailwind 3. This was initially time comsuming, but later rewarding as i could use Tailwind UI Component Library for all the frontend components.

Thereafter, the approach was simple, I read the requirement and tried to complete them one by one.

## Dislikes
The time frame of 2 days was pretty less for the amount of work required to delivery this project. I have worked 6-8 hours for 3 days to complete this work.
